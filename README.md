# Microprocessors-EMISY-
This repository contains all the labs and final project which was done during microprocessors course. 
It includes a project where I was supposed to design a vehicle on board computer. It involved selecting the right components, connected those components and then programming them. In this repository I have uploaded the schematic design of the project which was done on KIcad software.
